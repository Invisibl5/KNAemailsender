# KNA Email Sender – version and commit

When you change code in this project:

1. **Bump the version**  
   Update the `VERSION` constant in `Code.js` (e.g. `1.0.2` → `1.0.3`). Use the comment above it as a reminder.

2. **Commit and push**  
   After edits, always commit the changes and push to `main` so GitHub Actions can sync to Apps Script.

Example:
- Edit `Code.js` (and/or other files).
- In `Code.js`, set `const VERSION = '1.0.X';` to the next version.
- Run: `git add . && git commit -m "Brief description" && git push origin main`
