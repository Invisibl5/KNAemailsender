# KNA Email Sender – version and commit

**Every change:** bump the version, then commit and push. No exceptions.

1. **Bump the version**  
   Every time you edit the project, update the `VERSION` constant in `Code.js` (e.g. `1.0.31` → `1.0.32`). Do this even if the edit is small.

2. **Always commit and push**  
   After edits, always run: `git add . && git commit -m "Description" && git push origin main`. Never leave changes uncommitted or only committed without push.
